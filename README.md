# pattern-based-relation-extraction

In the ipynb file tasks, entity extraction and relation extraction across a collection of documents is performed. The zip archive contains 100 files, out of which 50 are plaintext documents and other 50 contain data structured as JSON. Each plaintext document contains a text description of a movie taken from the English version of Wikipedia, while each JSON document contains gold-standard labels (also called reference labels) stored as key-value pairs for the entities and relations for each document.
